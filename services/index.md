# WeNMR suite for Structural Biology

WeNMR is now part of the <a href="https://www.eosc-hub.eu/catalogue/WeNMR%20suite%20for%20Structural%20Biology" target="_blank">thematic services</a> implemented in the EOSC-Hub project.

## EOSC-hub WeNMR thematic services

The WeNMR offers different computational tools, composed of eight individual platforms:

* <a href="http://milou.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/DISVIS" target="_blank">DISVIS</a>, to visualise and quantify the accessible interaction space in macromolecular complexes
* <a href="http://milou.science.uu.nl/cgi/services/POWERFIT/powerfit/" target="_blank">POWERFIT</a>, for rigid body fitting of atomic structures into cryo-EM density maps
* <a href="http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/HADDOCK2.2/" target="_blank">HADDOCK</a>, to model complexes of proteins and other biomolecules
* <a href="http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/GROMACS/main.php" target="_blank">GROMACS</a>, to simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles
* <a href="http://py-enmr.cerm.unifi.it/access/index" target="_blank">AMPS-NMR</a>, a web portal for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) structures
* <a href="http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/CS-ROSETTA3/" target="_blank">CS-ROSETTA</a>, to model the 3D structure of proteins
* <a href="http://haddock.chem.uu.nl/enmr/services/UNIO/unio.php" target="_blank">UNIO</a>, to perform automated NMR data analysis for 3D protein structure determination
* <a href="http://abs.cerm.unifi.it:8080/" target="_blank">FANTEN</a>, for multiple alignment of nucleic acid and protein sequences


## How to access the service

The WeNMR platforms are freely available online and can be accessed by researchers upon registration.


## Service provideders

The WeNMR tools are provided by the <a href="http://www.uu.nl/" target="_blank">University of Utrecht</a>, the <a href="https://www.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html" target="_blank">University of Florence</a> and the <a href="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/crmn/pnmr/partners/cirmmp-italy/" target="_blank">Interuniversity consortium CIRMMP</a>.

The tools are powered by High-Throughput Compute capabilities provided by the EGI Federation and enhanced with software components developed by the INDIGO DataCloud project.

During EOSC-hub project, the WeNMR services will be integrated with EUDAT services and other components from the INDIGO catalogue.
