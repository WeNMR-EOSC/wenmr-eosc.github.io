## Online tutorials


### DISVIS

* [**DisVis web server tutorial**](https://bonvinlab.org/education/disvis-webserver/){:target="_blank"}: A small introduction into
  DisVis to analyse the interaction space between two molecules from a set of restraints. It can help to filter out putative 
  false positive restraints and predict key residues involved in the interaction from this set of restraints. 
  It makes use of our [web portal](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/disvis){:target="_blank"} (does not require Linux).


### Tutorials for HADDOCK version 2.4

* [**HADDOCK2.4 basic protein-protein docking tutorial**](https://bonvinlab.org/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-protein-protein-basic):
  A tutorial demonstrating the use of the HADDOCK web server to model a protein-protein complex using interface information derived from NMR chemical shift perturbation data.
  This tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of our web server and [PyMol](https://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**HADDOCK2.4 MS cross-links tutorial**](https://bonvinlab.org/education/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-Xlinks):
  A tutorial demonstrating the use of cross-linking data from mass spectrometry to guide the docking in HADDOCK.
  This tutorial builds on our [DisVis tutorial](/education/Others/disvis-webserver/) and illustrates various scenarios of using
  cross-linking data in HADDOCK.
  This tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of our web server and [PyMol](https://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

  In this tutorial you will have to solve an oligomer puzzle, namely predicting the correct oligomeric state
  of a symmetrical homomer complex based on a few (artificial) cross-links.
  The tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of the DISVIS and HADDOCK web servers and [PyMol](https://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**HADDOCK2.4 antibody-antigen docking tutorial**](https://bonvinlab.org/education/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-antibody-antigen):

  about the hypervariable loops of the antibody and either the entire surface of the antigen or a loose definition of the epitope.
